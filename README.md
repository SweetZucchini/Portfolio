# Dmytro Voitiuk Oleksandrovich, Portfolio

Hello, and welcome! This portfolio demonstrates skills associated with game development. In the Archive folder, you can find a collection of work related to the skills under which they are classified, showcasing the skill progress timeline. Moreover, since I am focused on developing as, firstly, a narrative designer and, secondly, as a 3D artist, two folders exist outside of the archive, showcasing the latest application of my skills with descriptions. Lastly, my CV is attached in the main folder.

I would like to conclude this introduction with links to my social media and other contact info:

- [Main account for publishing light novels in English](https://www.webnovel.com/profile/4313434219) - Currently with 2 separate books in drafts, without anything publicly accessible
- [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/дмитрий-войтюк-a92b06281)

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
